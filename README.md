# Locomotor_parameters_tierpsy
Code used for analysis of worm locomotion parameters using Tierpsy output features



  "__load and correct data_2.ipynb" accepts tierpsy output files ("metadata_featuresN.hdf5") from worms tracked after conditioning, and analyses the dataset in detail. 
  
  "__plot heatmaps using functions.ipynb" accepts the output summary files from "", and generates speed heatmaps. 
  
  "__cond_data_loadanalyse.ipynb"  accepts tierpsy output files ("metadata_featuresN.hdf5") from worms tracked during conditioning, and extracts percentage of time moving forward and backwards.
